   abstract = {Developmental deficits in the acquisition of writing skills (developmental dysgraphias) are common and have significant consequences, yet these deficits have received relatively little attention from researchers. We offer a framework for studying developmental dysgraphias (including both spelling and handwriting deficits), arguing that research should be grounded in theories describing normal cognitive writing mechanisms and the acquisition of these mechanisms. We survey the current state of knowledge concerning developmental dysgraphia, discussing potential proximal and distal causes. One conclusion emerging from this discussion is that developmental writing deficits are diverse in their manifestations and causes. We suggest an agenda for research on developmental dysgraphia, and suggest that pursuing this agenda may contribute not only to a better understanding of developmental writing impairment, but also to a better understanding of normal writing mechanisms and their acquisition. Finally, we provide a brief introduction to the subsequent articles in this special issue on developmental dysgraphia.},

   abstract = {Writing is an important and complex task that typically
develops in early childhood. Dysgraphia is a learning
disorder in which the individualâ€™s writing skills are below
the level expected for his or her age and cognitive level.
There are a variety of mechanisms by which dysgraphia
may occur. It can present in isolation or with other learning
or psychiatric disorders, and can often go undiagnosed.
Although the diagnosis and management of dysgraphia
usually occurs in an educational setting, the primary
physician plays an important role in guidance and
advocacy, as well as in the surveillance and evaluation of
potential co-morbid conditions. },

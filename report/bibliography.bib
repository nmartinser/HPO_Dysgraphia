   abstract = {Developmental deficits in the acquisition of writing skills (developmental dysgraphias) are common and have significant consequences, yet these deficits have received relatively little attention from researchers. We offer a framework for studying developmental dysgraphias (including both spelling and handwriting deficits), arguing that research should be grounded in theories describing normal cognitive writing mechanisms and the acquisition of these mechanisms. We survey the current state of knowledge concerning developmental dysgraphia, discussing potential proximal and distal causes. One conclusion emerging from this discussion is that developmental writing deficits are diverse in their manifestations and causes. We suggest an agenda for research on developmental dysgraphia, and suggest that pursuing this agenda may contribute not only to a better understanding of developmental writing impairment, but also to a better understanding of normal writing mechanisms and their acquisition. Finally, we provide a brief introduction to the subsequent articles in this special issue on developmental dysgraphia.},

   abstract = {Writing is an important and complex task that typically
develops in early childhood. Dysgraphia is a learning
disorder in which the individual’s writing skills are below
the level expected for his or her age and cognitive level.
There are a variety of mechanisms by which dysgraphia
may occur. It can present in isolation or with other learning
or psychiatric disorders, and can often go undiagnosed.
Although the diagnosis and management of dysgraphia
usually occurs in an educational setting, the primary
physician plays an important role in guidance and
advocacy, as well as in the surveillance and evaluation of
potential co-morbid conditions. },

   abstract = {Dysgraphia, a disorder affecting the written expression of symbols and words, negatively impacts the academic results of pupils as well as their overall well-being. The use of automated procedures can make dysgraphia testing available to larger populations, thereby facilitating early intervention for those who need it. In this paper, we employed a machine learning approach to identify handwriting deteriorated by dysgraphia. To achieve this goal, we collected a new handwriting dataset consisting of several handwriting tasks and extracted a broad range of features to capture different aspects of handwriting. These were fed to a machine learning algorithm to predict whether handwriting is affected by dysgraphia. We compared several machine learning algorithms and discovered that the best results were achieved by the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. The results show that machine learning can be used to detect dysgraphia with almost 80% accuracy, even when dealing with a heterogeneous set of subjects differing in age, sex and handedness.},
